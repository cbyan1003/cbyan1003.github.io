Biography
======
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. I received my M.Eng. and B.Eng. degrees from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xiâ€™an, China, in 2025 and 2022, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Mingtao Feng. My research focuses on 3D computer vision, particularly in areas such as point cloud registration and 3D scene graph.
